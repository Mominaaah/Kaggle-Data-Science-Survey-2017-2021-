# Data Cleaning & Insights: Kaggle Data Science Survey (2017–2021)

## Overview
This project analyzes the Kaggle **Data Science Survey (2017–2021)** dataset to extract actionable insights about respondents’ demographics, professional background, and technology usage. The goal is to **clean the dataset, handle categorical variables, and generate visual insights** that summarize key trends.


## Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle Data Science Survey (2017–2021)  

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python 3.x**  
- **Pandas** – Data cleaning & manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda)** – Interactive analysis  

## Key Visual Insights
The analysis produced **7 core visuals**:

1. **Top 10 Countries** – shows highest survey participation by country  
2. **Gender Distribution** – highlights proportion of male, female, and other respondents  
3. **Education Levels (Top 5)** – displays most common academic backgrounds  
4. **Salary Distribution** – shows income ranges of respondents  
5. **Age Groups** – identifies dominant age brackets  
6. **Not Answered Responses per Year** – tracks survey engagement and missing responses.
7. **ML Usage by Country** – compares Machine Learning adoption across top countries  

## Insights & Highlights
- Respondents are mainly concentrated in a few countries, with younger age groups (18–34) dominating.  
- Majority hold undergraduate or postgraduate degrees.  
- Salary and ML adoption vary significantly across regions.  
- Missing responses reveal survey engagement patterns across years.
